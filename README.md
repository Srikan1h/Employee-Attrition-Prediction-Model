A predictive model to estimate whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on their personal and professional factors. Complete end-to-end ML project with data cleaning, analysis, and model deployment.

#Project Overview

**Key Features Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and converts categorical data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uses visualizations to uncover key insights and patterns in the data, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing attrition.

**Model Development: **Trains a predictive model, such as Logistic Regression, to forecast an employee's likelihood of leaving.
**
Model Evaluation: **Assesses model performance using key metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to ensure it's effective in a real-world scenario.

**Model Deployment:** Saves the trained model as a .pkl file for future use, demonstrating a complete and reusable machine learning pipeline.

### Tech Stack The following technologies and libraries were used to build this project:
------------


**Python: **The core programming language.

**pandas:** For efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

**scikit-learn: **The primary library for machine learning, used for data splitting, model training, and evaluation.
**
matplotlib & seaborn: **Used for creating insightful data visualizations and plots.

**pickle:** For serializing and saving the trained machine learning model.

###  How to Run the Project To run this project, you will need to have Python installed.
------------


##### Clone the repository:


    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Employee-Attrition-Prediction.git


##### Navigate to the project directory:



    cd Employee-Attrition-Prediction

##### Install the required libraries:



    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

##### Run the Jupyter Notebook: run the jupyter notebook: the project is contained within a single jupyter notebook. open it and run the cells sequentially to see the full pipeline in action.
