# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Model
A predictive model to estimate whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on their personal and professional factors. Complete end-to-end ML project with data cleaning, analysis, and model deployment.

Project Overview

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and converts categorical data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses visualizations to uncover key insights and patterns in the data, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing attrition.

Model Development: Trains a predictive model, such as Logistic Regression, to forecast an employee's likelihood of leaving.

Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using key metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to ensure it's effective in a real-world scenario.

Model Deployment: Saves the trained model as a .pkl file for future use, demonstrating a complete and reusable machine learning pipeline.

Tech Stack
The following technologies and libraries were used to build this project:

Python: The core programming language.

pandas: For efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

scikit-learn: The primary library for machine learning, used for data splitting, model training, and evaluation.

matplotlib & seaborn: Used for creating insightful data visualizations and plots.

pickle: For serializing and saving the trained machine learning model.
